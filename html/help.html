				<span class="heading2">What is Join?</span>
				<span>
					<span class="join-color">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by
					a group of dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.<br><br>

					Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
					work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <span class="join-color">Join</span> leverages
					the principles of kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.<br><br>

					It is important to note that <span class="join-color">Join</span> is designed as an educational
					exercise and is not intended for extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible
					user experience, we cannot guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects
					of quality regarding <span class="join-color">Join</span>.

							<span>
								In <span class="join-color">Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects.
								Go to the "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in the required information.
								Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.

						<span class="numbering">3.</span>
						<div>
							<span class="heading3">Adding Cards</span><br>
							<span>
								Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual
								tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the
								task details in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.

								and dropping the card from one list to another.

					<div class="frame187">
						<span class="numbering">5.</span>
						<div>
							<span class="heading3">Deleting Cards</span><br>
							<span>
								Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting
								a card will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting
								cards, as this action is irreversible.<br><br>

								Remember that using <span class="join-color">Join</span> effectively requires consistent
								updates from you and your team to ensure the board reflects the current state of your
								project.<br><br>
